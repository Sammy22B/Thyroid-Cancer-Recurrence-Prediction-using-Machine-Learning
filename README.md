# Thyroid-Cancer-Recurrence-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
A predictive ML model that identifies thyroid cancer recurrence risk based on patient demographics, diagnosis, and treatment history using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
# üß¨ Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Detection using Machine Learning

This project predicts the **likelihood of thyroid cancer recurrence** in patients based on their medical history, diagnostic findings, and treatment details. Using supervised machine learning algorithms, the model classifies whether a patient is likely to experience a **recurrence (Yes/No)** of thyroid cancer after treatment.

---

## üéØ Objective
To develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the **recurrence of thyroid cancer** in previously diagnosed patients using clinical, pathological, and treatment-related parameters.  
The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients early, enabling personalized follow-up and intervention strategies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Loaded dataset and inspected structure and missing values  
- Dropped rows with missing entries  
- Converted categorical variables into numeric codes  
- Scaled continuous variables (e.g., `Age`) using **StandardScaler**  
- Encoded target variable `Recurred` as binary (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized data distributions and relationships:
- Class distribution of recurrence vs. non-recurrence  
- Age distribution among patients  
- Correlation heatmap of features  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training
Implemented and evaluated multiple models:

| Model | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Logistic Regression | Baseline linear classifier |
| Random Forest (Tuned) | Ensemble model tuned with GridSearchCV |
| XGBoost | Gradient boosting model optimized for classification |

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
Each model was assessed using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score**
- **Confusion Matrix Visualization**
- **ROC-AUC Score**

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Comparison
Models were compared based on overall accuracy and F1-score through bar chart visualization.
